# Project 1: Rasterizer

## Project Overview

In this project, I implemented and explored various rasterization and sampling schemes for rendering two dimensional images. 
This encompasses very simple approaches, like basic nearest neighbor point sampling, to intermediate approaches such as supersampling,
 all the way to more advanced techniques such as trilinear texture sampling. One of my basic goals with this project is to visually 
demonstrate the differences in these approaches while also making note of the computational requirements of each technique. Additionally,
 although these techniques are all used within the context of this project to render two dimensional images, they could easily be extended
 or extrapolated to other tasks as well.

Additionally, as is the case with any academic project, great value is also yielded by the implementation of algorithms. Making note of 
various formulae and sets of equations on paper is one thing, but actually implementing them often requires digging into and understanding
 them at a much deeper level.
